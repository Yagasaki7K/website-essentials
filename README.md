# 🚀 Features

Many people after formatting the computer forget about which software they have installed, which is the best browser to use, which text editor to encode that program or even which version of the operating system they find to install on another computer. Instead of jumping from site to site in search of this information, I developed essentials, a web tool that shows through list; Softwares that are useful for your computer and that no longer need to stay in your head, so you can worry about other things.

# 🚧 How to run
```bash
# Clone Repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Yagasaki7K/website-essentials.git
$ Go to folder using terminal
$ yarn (needs yarn installed)
$ yarn dev (if you wanna change something) // yarn start (just to see running)
```

If you need change something, check using yarn build if everything is okay. And later you do a PR.
